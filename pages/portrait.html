              I am an award-winning photographer and have been lucky enough to work with some of the business's biggest brands and creative agencies including Saatchi & Saatchi and EE.<br>
              <br>
              Having studied languages at UCL, my obsession with people and places has led to a diverse portfolio of work.<br>
              <br>
              My experience as an advertising creative means I am always looking for the "why" behind every image.
              I specialise in commercial, fashion and portrait photography.               <br>
