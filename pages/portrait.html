                        I have worked as a photographer for the past 6 years and have been lucky enough to work with some of the business's biggest brands and creative agencies including Saatchi & Saatchi and EE, with my work featured in major advertising sites and publications. <br>
            <br>
            Having studied languages at UCL, my obsession with people and places has led to a diverse portfolio of work. I approach every project at full velocity – each is an opportunity to create something unique. <br>
            <br>
            My experience as an advertising creative means I am always looking for the "why" behind every image.
